% USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA
% 
% These data are made freely available to the public and the
% scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
% will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
% The availability of these data does not constitute publication
% of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
% assure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data 
% are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, 
% ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.  
% If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important 
% result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship
% may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
% the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL
% for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
% insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
% represented.

% RECIPROCITY
% 
% Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
% Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
% own data available to the general public and to the scientific
% community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
% Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
% upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
% of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport
% fields, and additional information necessary for other
% scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
% Model availability includes collaborative support for new
% users of the models.

%  
% Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
% of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
% Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
%
% The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation
% of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by
% NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
%
% NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, 
% depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
% control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
% reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
