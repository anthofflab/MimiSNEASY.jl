 ========================================
| For the impatient:                     |
|  1. On Linux type make                 |
|     On MacOS type make -f Makefile.mac |
|  2. Type ./SNEASY                      |
|  3. Start Matlab                       |
|  4. Type viewESys                      |
 ========================================

Required software:
    Fortran90 compiler
    GNU make
    Matlab or R to visualize output

 =============================================================================
| To use the Earth System model or DOECLIM as a shared library with R:
|  1. Be sure that -fPIC is enabled as a compiler flag in the Makefile.
|  2. Type 'make sneasy.so' or 'make doeclim.so' (without quotes).
|     On MacOS type 'make -f Makefile.mac sneasy.so'
|  3. Start R.
|  4. Type 'source("sneasy_demo.R")' or 'source("doeclim_demo.R")'

moc_boxmodel.f90:
   original author: Kirsten Zickfeld
   received by Klaus Keller April 30, 2003
   Modified 6/22/05 by K. Brennan to delay warming by 50 years and
      add noise to overturning (=m*fact).  
   Modified 1/5/07 by N. Urban to add noise to surface temperatures and 
      salinity instead of to overturning.
   Modified 1/31/07 by N. Urban to accept temperature forcing as an argument
      rather than hardcoding a linear->constant trend.
   Translated 8/27/08 by Brian Tuttle <btuttle@psu.edu> from Matlab to
      Fortran 90 module.
