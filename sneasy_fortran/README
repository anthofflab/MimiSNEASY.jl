The following was tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 with version 11.1 of
the Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort) and R 2.14.0 -- you will likely need to
make adjustments for success on other systems.

(1) Build the SNEASY shared library:

    $ cd sneasy
    $ make sneasy.so

(2) Run the assimilation:
    
    $ cd ../R
    $ Rscript climassim.R

The second step may take 30 minutes or more to complete, depending on your
hardware.  You should end up with two PDF files, each containing a panel of
plots, in the 'R' subdirectory and four '.RData' files in 'output'
subdirectory.  Additional plots are possible using other scripts in the 'R'
subdirectory.
